 # Rupee Collector
  In this assignment we had to make a simple web based game that focused on jQuery. You will be givin a random number to start the game. Four rupees are displayed representing four random numbers that are unknown to the player. Clicking a rupee will add to the current score essentially revealing how much that rupee is worth. The goal is to get your score to match the number generated at the beginning of the game.
